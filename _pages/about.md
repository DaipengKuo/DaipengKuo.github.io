I am a first-year Ph.D. candidate at the [School of Electronic Information Engineering](https://dxxy.xatu.edu.cn/), [Xi'an Technological University](https://www.xatu.edu.cn/). My research focuses on **computer vision**, **facial expression recognition**, and **affective computing**, with special interest in attention mechanisms and multi-scale feature fusion.

My recent work "*Research on Facial Expression Recognition Based on Wide Attention and Multi-Scale Fusion Mechanism*" explores efficient emotion recognition architectures. I'm actively investigating deep learning approaches for robust facial behavior analysis.
